    "##### **Cloud Functions**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Serverless** execution environment, like App Engine<br>\n",
    "meaning no need to provision any server, or updating VMs, as the infrastructure is all handled by Google<br>\n",
    "unlike App Engine, you'll never see the server<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**FaaS** - Function as a Service<br>\n",
    "this is where you upload code purposely in a supported language<br>\n",
    "when your code is trigger, it's executed in a fully managed environment<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Functions runs in a **runtime** environment - Python, Java, Node.js, Go, .NET core<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event-driven** - so when something happens in your environment, you can choose whether to respond to the event<br>\n",
    "Triggers - HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Firestore, Firebase<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Billing** - time + resources provisioned (memory)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There's **free tier**, which allows 2 million invocations of your function<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Cloud Functions work**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Trigger -> Written Code (+ optional settings) -> HTTP/Background functions -> bind the trigger -> Cloud Build<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting name and region that you want the function to live in<br>\n",
    "You'd then select the trigger you wish to use<br>\n",
    "Ex. Triggers - HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Firestore, Firebase<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Trigger is a declaration that you're interested in a certain event<br>\n",
    "binding a function to the trigger allows you to capture and act on these events<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "authentication configuration is the next step<br>\n",
    "and can be selected with a public access<br>\n",
    "or configured through IAM<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "there are optional settings that can be configured<br>\n",
    "you'd provide the amount of memory the function will need to run<br>\n",
    "networking preferences<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "once the selections been solidified,<br>\n",
    "written code can be put into the function<br>\n",
    "it supports variety of languages: Python, Java, Node.js, Go, .NET core<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There's 2 distinctive type of Cloud Functions that you could use:<br>\n",
    "**HTTP functions and Background functions**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "with HTTP functions, you invoke them from standard HTTP requests<br>\n",
    "these requests wait for the response and support handling of common HTTP request methods<br>\n",
    "like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS<br>\n",
    "TLS certificate is automatically provisioned for you<br>\n",
    "so all HTTP functions can be invoked via secure connection<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "when it comes to background connections<br>\n",
    "these are used to handle events from GCP infrastructure<br>\n",
    "such as messages on Pub/Sub topic, or changes in a Cloud Storage bucket<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're ready to deploy your code<br>\n",
    "first one is binding of trigger to your function<br>\n",
    "once you bind the trigger, you can't bind another one to the same function<br>\n",
    "only 1 trigger can be bound at a time<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "second thing that'll happen<br>\n",
    "source code will be stored in a Cloud Storage bucket as a zip file<br>\n",
    "Cloud Build, auto builds your code into a container image<br>\n",
    "pushes that image to the container registry<br>\n",
    "Cloud function accesses this image, when it needs to run the container to execute your function<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the build is complete, we now wait for an event to happen<br>\n",
    "events are things that happen within your cloud environment that you might want to take an action on<br>\n",
    "these are like: data changes in Cloud SQL, files added to Cloud Storage, or new VM being created<br>\n",
    "and other services like: Bigquery, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "when an event triggers the execution of your Cloud function<br>\n",
    "data associated with the event is passed via function's parameters<br>\n",
    "the type of the event determines the parameters that are passed to your function<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud function handles incoming requests by assigning them to instances of your function<br>\n",
    "Depending on the volume of the request, as well as number of existing function instances<br>\n",
    "Cloud function may assign request to an existing instance or create a new one<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud function will grab the image from Cloud registry and hand off the image along with the event data<br>\n",
    "to instances for processing<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instances of function will handle only 1 concurrent request at a time<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "fuctions has to be stateless, they aren't meant to be persistent nor is the data passed on to the function<br>\n",
    "after function has run, and processed, it's passed on to VPC or to the internet<br>\n",
    "by default, functions have public internet access, unless configured otherwise<br>\n",
    "functions can be private and used within VPC, but must be configured before the deployment<br>\n",
