    "Your organization plans to migrate its financial transaction monitoring application to Google Cloud. Auditors need to view the data and run reports in BigQuery, but they are not allowed to perform transactions in the application. You are leading the migration and want the simplest solution that will require the least amount of maintenance. What should you do?<br>\n",
    "A. Assign roles/bigquery.dataViewer to the individual auditors.<br>\n",
    "B. Create a group for auditors and assign roles/viewer to them.<br>\n",
    "**C. Create a group for auditors, and assign roles/bigquery.dataViewer to them.<br>**\n",
    "D. Assign a custom role to each auditor that allows view-only access to BigQuery.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback<br>\n",
    "A is not correct because Google recommended practice is to assign IAM roles to groups, not individuals. Groups are easier to manage than individual users and they provide high level visibility into roles and permissions.<br>\n",
    "B is not correct because it uses a basic role to give auditors view access to all resources on the project.<br>\n",
    "C is correct because it uses a predefined role to provide view access to BigQuery for the group of auditors. Auditors can be added or deleted from the group if job responsibilities change.<br>\n",
    "D is not correct because using a predefined role can accomplish the goal and requires less maintenance.<br>\n",

    "You are managing your company’s first Google Cloud project. Project leads, developers, and internal testers will participate in the project, which includes sensitive information. You need to ensure that only specific members of the development team have access to sensitive information. You want to assign the appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that also require the least amount of maintenance. What should you do?<br>\n",
    "A. Assign a basic role to each user.<br>\n",
    "B. Create groups. Assign a basic role to each group, and then assign users to groups.<br>\n",
    "C. Create groups. Assign a Custom role to each group, including those who should have access to sensitive data. Assign users to groups.<br>\n",
    "**D. Create groups. Assign an IAM Predefined role to each group as required, including those who should have access to sensitive data. Assign users to groups.<br>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback<br>\n",
    "A is not correct for two reasons: The recommended practice is to use groups and not to assign roles to each user. Beyond that, Basic Roles do not have enough granularity to account for access to sensitive data.<br>\n",
    "B is not correct because Basic roles do not have enough granularity to account for access to sensitive data.<br>\n",
    "C is not correct because creating and maintaining Custom roles will require more maintenance than using Predefined roles.<br>\n",
    "D is correct because Predefined roles are fine-grained enough to set permissions for specific roles requiring sensitive data access. This solution also uses groups, which is the recommended practice for managing permissions for individual roles.<br>\n",

    "Your project team needs to estimate the spending for your Google Cloud project for the next quarter. You know the project requirements. You want to produce your estimate as quickly as possible. What should you do?<br>\n",

    "A is not correct because, although ML produces excellent results in many areas, there are more straightforward approaches that require less time to produce an estimate.<br>\n",
    "B is not correct because you need to add other charges, such as storage and data egress charges.<br>\n",
    "C is correct because the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator quickly gives the result, and you know the resources required for the project.<br>\n",
    "D is not correct because volume discounts, also called sustained use discounts, are applied automatically and are included in the calculator estimates.<br>\n",
